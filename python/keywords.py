### Python Keywords:
These are words that have a predefined meaning in Python and cannot be used as variable names or identifiers.

1. **Constants**:
   - `True`, `False`, `None`: Represent the true boolean value, false boolean value, and null value, respectively.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - `if`, `else`, `elif`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, `in`: Used in control structures and loops.

3. **Defining Entities**:
   - `def`, `class`, `lambda`: Used for defining functions, classes, and anonymous functions (lambda functions).

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`: Used for handling exceptions.

5. **Importing**:
   - `import`, `from`, `as`: Used for importing modules, functions, or objects from modules.

6. **Miscellaneous**:
   - `assert`, `pass`, `global`, `nonlocal`, `del`: Used for various purposes like assertion, defining placeholders, working with global and non-local scopes, and deleting objects.

### Reserved Words:
These are words that are not currently used as keywords but are reserved for potential future use in Python.

- `async`, `await`: Introduced in Python 3.5, used for asynchronous programming.
- Other reserved words might be introduced in future versions of Python.

It's important to note that using keywords or reserved words as variable names or identifiers will result in syntax errors. So, it's best practice to avoid using them for naming your variables, functions, or classes to prevent conflicts and ensure code clarity.
