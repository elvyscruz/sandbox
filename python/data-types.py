## diference 

'''
List (list):
Mutable: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after creation.
Ordered: Elements in a list are ordered and indexed, maintaining the order of insertion.
Syntax: Created with square brackets [].
Example: [1, 2, 'apple', True]

Tuple (tuple):
Immutable: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
Ordered: Like lists, tuples maintain the order of elements.
Syntax: Created with parentheses ().
Example: (1, 2, 'banana', False)

Dictionary (dict):
Key-Value Pairs: Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs.
Unordered: Unlike lists and tuples, dictionaries are unordered and accessed by keys rather than indexes.
Syntax: Created with curly braces {}, where each entry is key: value.
Example: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

Set (set):
Unique Elements: Sets contain only unique elements; duplicates are automatically removed.
Unordered: Sets donâ€™t maintain any specific order of elements.
Syntax: Created with curly braces {}, without any duplicate elements.
Example: {1, 2, 3, 4}
